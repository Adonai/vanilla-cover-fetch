# Vanilla Music Player Cover Fetch Plugin

This repository hosts the Cover Fetch plugin for Vanilla Music.
Prior to downloading it, you should have the [Vanilla Music Player](https://github.com/vanilla-music/vanilla) app installed.

Once both the player and this plugin are installed, request a context menu from the library screen, and select "Plugins" and "Cover fetch" afterwards.
Note that this plugin requires an internet connection to actually be useful.
